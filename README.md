# Project Spark Helper Bot 🔥

[project-spark-helper-bot.lovable.app](https://project-spark-helper-bot.lovable.app)

A lightweight personal task manager I built to help keep track of everyday tasks. It’s super simple, works in the browser, and focuses on getting things done without all the clutter.

---

## ✨ What it does

- ✅ Quickly add tasks  
- 📅 See what’s due today, coming up, or everything at once  
- 🏷️ Add priorities, tags, and due dates  
- 🔔 Get reminder notifications  
- 🌱 Works on desktop and mobile (still improving layout)

---

## 💡 What I *want* to add

I’m working on integrating **AI-based task parsing**, so eventually you’ll be able to type something like:

> _“Submit lab report by next Thursday evening”_

…and the app will automatically fill in the task title and deadline.

Planned ideas:
- Suggestions for breaking big tasks into smaller steps  
- Natural language reminders  
- Goal tracking or recurring tasks

## 🗂️ Example use

1. Add a task:  
   _“Clean apartment – due Friday – high priority”_  
2. Manually pick due date, priority, and tag (for now!)  
3. Get reminders, mark tasks as done, or edit them later
